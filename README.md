## How to Play

Use your arrow keys or on screen buttons to move the upper and lower selectors at the bottom of the screen, if you think highlighted middle row matches your current level press Enter (or the row itself on mobile) to advance to the next level.
<br>
The game is completed after finishing all 7 levels.

## Highscores
A web server to hold leaderboards is also being developed using TypeScript.<br>
The server will have leaderboards for the fastest  individual level match and also the fastest round completion time.
